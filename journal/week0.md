```One of the interesting things I needed to tweak a little bit was the Momento logo. Andrew showed how he was editing this via Visual Studio Code and removed a couple of tags. 

I ended up changing the fill from none to black on the first line as well as removing the fill="currentColor"> for both path tags. 

I added the momento_logo_original.svg and momento_logo.svg within the assets directory
```
