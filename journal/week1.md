# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Reproducing Session ##

I joined the live session to follow along with the demo and conversation.

I created a new branch and kept all my activities on that one. At the end of the required activities, I merged everything to main.

For anyone that is not using Google Chrome and the Gitpod plugin, you can create a workspace out of a branch by adding */tree/name-of-branch* at the end of the standard URL:

```
https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ucaninthecloud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/tree/week1-session
```

Below is the code that I submited a PR for. I tried to submit early in the week but I missed a couple steps after my fork was created.

```sh
docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it backend-flask
FRONTEND_URL="*" BACKEND_URL="*" docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it backend-flask
export FRONTEND_URL="*"
export BACKEND_URL="*"
docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it  -e FRONTEND_URL -e BACKEND_URL backend-flask
unset FRONTEND_URL
unset BACKEND_URL
docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' backend-flask
```

For some reason, I still don't trust Gitpod 100% to store my AWS secret access key so, I created a new _reference directory in my repo to place all my *pre-requisites*

Updated .gitpod.yml to include the npm install in the /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddr-2023/frontend-react-js:

```yml
  - name: npm front-end
    init: |
      cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddr-2023/frontend-react-js
      npm install
```

## My Journey to the Cloud!

I am going to become a **Cloud Platform Engineer**

I am a good fit because **I am interested in enabling developers to get the infrastructure they need in a better and repeatable way via a self-service approach.**
